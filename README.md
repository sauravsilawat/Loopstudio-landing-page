### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Through this challenge I learn how to create a fully responsive website with different sections, it was tough to manage all the section and make them responsive at the same time, but i did it and almost satisfied with the final product. This challenge helped me to dig deep in the concepts of css flexbox, pseudo-selectors and all the advance css techniques. Now I feel pretty confident in designing a responsive site from scratch.
